            <h2>A Paragraph about me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Kathir Maarikarthykeyan and I am a freshman computer science and engineering student at The Ohio State University. 
            I am originally from Delaware, Ohio which is about 20 minutes from The Ohio State University. 
            Although I am from Delaware, Ohio, I am originally from Chennai, India. I was born there and I moved to Delaware when I was three years old.</p>
            <p>I enjoy playing tennis, basketball, and volleyball in my free time. In high school, I played tennis for four years on the varsity team. 
            Some of my other hobbies include biking and watching the NBA. My favorite NBA player is Luka Doncic. I am planning on joining AI club, Waffle House club, and the competitive programming club as well.
            I also play the viola as I have played for 9 years as part of my school's orchestra. I also like listening to music as it is one of the most important aspects of my life. 
            My favorite artists include Drake, Kendrick Lamar, and Daniel Caesar. Although most of my favorite artists are in hip-hop, I listen to many genres of music including RandB, pop, and even some country from time to time 
            (unfortunately my mom puts it on a lot). Another big part of my life is my family. I live with my mom, dad, little sister, and two dogs (A german shepherd and a poodle mix).</p>
